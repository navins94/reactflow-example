# ReactFlow Example

This project is a demonstration of using the ReactFlow library to create a flow builder with nodes and edges. The flow builder supports different types of nodes and allows connections between them using edges.

## Features

- Add and remove nodes from the flow builder.
- Connect nodes together by creating edges.
- Drag and drop nodes from a panel onto the flow builder.
- Supports multiple types of nodes, including text nodes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navins94/reactflow-example
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd reactflow-example
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the flow builder to create your desired flow:

- Drag and drop nodes from the nodes panel onto the flow builder canvas.
- Connect nodes together by clicking and dragging from one node to another.
- Remove nodes or edges by selecting them and pressing the delete key.
